# PhyloLFR

Just a school project that I took a little further and wanted to keep for presentation purposes.

The idea was to code an algorithm for phylogenetic processing and understand the idea behind the newick format. We had the choice between LCA, Fitch, Reconciliation or several of them so I decided to implement them all.
